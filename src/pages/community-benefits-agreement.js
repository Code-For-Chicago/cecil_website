      <p>We have published <a style={{color:'#10AC84'}} href="https://mailchi.mp/clccrul/cannabis-equity-coalition-natures-care-cba"> press release</a> announcing our very first CBA with a dispensary!

      <p>That's why, alongside <a style={{color:'#10AC84'}} target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.clccrul.org/">Chicago Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights</a>, we've drafted a Community Benefits Agrement</p>

We encourage you to join us, especially at public meetings for proposed dispensaries in Chicago 2020 &mdash; for the most up to date public meetings regarding new sites for cannabis businesses, DM or follow us <a style={{color:"#10AC84"}} href="https://www.facebook.com/CannaEquityIL" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@CannaEquityIL</a></p>
