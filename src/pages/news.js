    <h1>Happy New Year!</h1>
    <p>As 2019 comes to a close, we want to thank everyone who’s played a role in supporting our work this year. Whether you came to a meeting to voice your opinion, helped us organize our events for National Expungement Week, came to our lobby days in Springfield, or shared our information on social media, we appreciate you!</p>
    <p>Legalization is happening in Illinois. It’s not happening in the way we hoped it would, but that doesn’t mean we are going to be silent about the issues that we have with the rollout.</p>
    <p>Come January, we are going to hit the ground running to ensure legal cannabis in Illinois is done to support people and communities most impacted by the War on Drug, and not to benefit multi-state corporations and cash-hungry politicians.</p>
    <p>We invite you all to come to our meetings in Back of the Yards (Starting January 9th), help us organize Know Your Rights and expungement events, advocate with us at City Hall and in Springfield. If you have ideas and suggestions for other ways to make an impact, we're <a style={{color:"#10AC84"}} href="https://www.facebook.com/CannaEquityIL" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@CannaEquityIL</a>, DM us!</p>
    <p>We look forward to building an even larger movement supporting cannabis equity, so that Chicago and Illinois can be a model in the post-prohibition world.</p>
    <p>Enjoy a warm and peaceful New Year!</p>
